// Have each button be assigned a random value between 1 and 12 and change between each round. 

// Have click functions assigned to each button to add the present value to the total score. 

// Set conditions for wins and losses. If the total score is over the computerGuess then the round is over and it counts as a loss (losses--;). 

// If the player score is exactly matched to the computerGuess then the player wins (wins++;).

// Once the player reaches 5 wins or 5 losses then the game is over and everything resets.
